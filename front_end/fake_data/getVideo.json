one\n\n81\n00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607\n10 - 2\n\n82\n00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,287\n10-2 so tell me again\n\n83\n00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823\nOne red\n\n84\n00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407\nOkay\n\n85\n00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503\nSo that is equal to\n\n86\n00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319\nAnd into n minus 1 by 2\n\n87\n00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439\nThe what the Big O for this\n\n88\n00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511\nThat's the number of steps\n\n89\n00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839\nIs equal to\n\n90\n00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447\nN Square\n\n91\n00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,031\nOkay is it all off in\n\n92\n00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711\nCan it be off into the profile\n\n93\n00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479\nElga\n\n94\n00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879\nSo let's think about Omega-3\n\n95\n00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999\nAnd square\n\n96\n00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095\nKennedy in\n\n97\n00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863\nYes\n\n98\n00:08:05,375 -->

00:08:43,007\nOmega is the lower bound Peter is the tightest boundary\n\n110\n00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127\nThat is both from upper side and Lower Side\n\n111\n00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479\nIf you have\n\n112\n00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343\n11 squared and Omega Red Square then it must be mm square\n\n113\n00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719\nOkay so this is\n\n114\n00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767\nNot to confuse with\n\n115\n00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,399\nDifferent kinds of analysis letter if I want to ask for tequila questions\n\n116\n00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215\nFour baskets in Alice\n\n117\n00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,103\nAre worth getting a little you think of this as worst-case situation\n\n118\n00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407\nWhat average gas mileage\n\n119\n00:09:21,919

loop runs for the first time\n\n157\n00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527\nSecond time\n\n158\n00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,207\n2N is equal to in by 2\n\n159\n00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071\nThe second time how many times does Louisville run\n\n160\n00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887\nHow many times\n\n161\n00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703\nInvite to\n\n162\n00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,799\nSatin by two\n\n163\n00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615\nCurrent time\n\n164\n00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711\nAnd by 4\n\n165\n00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295\nUptown yoga\n\n166\n00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879\nYou got one right\n\n167\n00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463\nSo if you add this thing\n\n168\n00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999\nWhat happened\n\n169\n00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335\nThis is actually less than 2 in\n\n170\n00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551\nOkay\n\n171\n00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391\nHow is it to end\n\n172\n00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487\nIf you might have some series you're right one by two\n\n173\n00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,327\nSo it's basically an\n\n174\n00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887\n-1 divided by\n\n175\n00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,287\nWhat's a 1-1 by to find something like that\n\n176\n00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,455\nFigured out at home how you can finish that this is actually\n\n177\n00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735\n2N\n\n178\n00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671\nAlright let's

00:15:54,367\nWhat is this the tightest Big O for this\n\n188\n00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695\nThe tightest Big O\n\n189\n00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167\nIf it's not the tightest it's is this okay\n\n190\n00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055\nSo that's okay that's not the tightest question\n\n191\n00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,479\nIsn't this an infinite Loop\n\n192\n00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527\nWhy there's no infinite Loop\n\n193\n00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183\nWhen you start dividing by 2 and N is an integer\n\n194\n00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:35,071\nIf you started it by tomorrow at some point of time and will be equal to\n\n195\n00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607\nZero\n\n196\n00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679\nNbc.com\n\n197\n00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,031\nWhen anyone won back to

00:17:01,183\nHow long does it take to find whether or not an element is\n\n201\n00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975\nSorted linked list\n\n202\n00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255\nOkay\n\n203\n00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583\nRemember tricky question\n\n204\n00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471\nHow long does it take\n\n205\n00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735\nNS sorted linked list\n\n206\n00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439\nOkay 5 more seconds\n\n207\n00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,535\nOne two three\n\n208\n00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607\n45 stop\n\n209\n00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127\nOkay\n\n210\n00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247\nThat's some people who study\n\n211\n00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,879\nSo I want to hear why people said who said he okay\n\n212\n00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543\nFor some it's old one\n\n213\n00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527\nSaw the way you access this link this is from this point the right you cannot directly on them\n\n214\n00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551\nExcessive\n\n215\n00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,999\nBut you are right so for some it's worth one for which one is 12 one\n\n216\n00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655\nFor a constant number of a letter we have in the first few\n\n217\n00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,519\nIf the numbers are the first relocation is 2 of 1\n\n218\n00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,127\nSo far if you're searching one it's all of One\n\n219\n00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,855\nIf you're starting to you can also think of that old one because not depending on the end it's too\n\n220\n00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391\nOkay\n\n221\n00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671\nIt is\n\n222\n00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,327\nSo here actually I didn't specify\n\n223\n00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,239\nI didn't specify whether you're looking for the worst case\n\n224\n00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055\nAre the best gas\n\n225\n00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359\nAre the average case\n\n226\n00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223\nSo there is not enough information\n\n227\n00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695\nSo I mean this is not to be confused with so we have\n\n228\n00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,767\nWhat's the worst-case right\n\n229\n00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887\nOur best case\n\n230\n00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447\nAre average gay\n\n231\n00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543\nBut this has nothing to do with\n\n232\n00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823\nHow\n\n233\n00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871\nRecalculate\n\n234\n00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,991\nOrnate Omega or Tita\n\n235\n00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,087\nSo for each one of them I can have it analysis done\n\n236\n00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415\nSecond Step what were the worst Kidz Bop\n\n237\n00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,255\nSo you can have them what's the best case that you can have\n\n238\n00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559\nPapa bondye Bon Appetit Owen\n\n239\n00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655\nWhat's the average game you can have all of this analysis\n\n240\n00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543\nSo this is just something to think about right when you\n\n241\n00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615\nDo analysis runtime analysis\n\n242\n00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759\nSo if I say what's the worst case\n\n243\n00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551\nRuntime\n\n244\n00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,159\nFor the tightest upper bound\n\n245\n00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999\nThen how would you answer it\n\n246\n00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:55,167\nOpen that's a worst-case Applebaum\n\n247\n00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,567\nAt Westgate Bingo okay\n\n248\n00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431\nOkay\n\n249\n00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,783\nZenefits well let's see\n\n250\n00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343\nSo you already answered this\n\n251\n00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512\nHow long does it take to find whether or not an element in the sorted linked list in the bay\n\n252\n00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,864\nOkay so we're looking at the best case\n\n253\n00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,192\nAnd I will thinking about\n\n254\n00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056\nThe tightest upper bound here\n\n255\n00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848\nSo what's the best case\n\n256\n00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432\n12 1\n\n257\n00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112\nOkay so what happened in the worst case\n\n258\n00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904\nCertiFit store dent\n\n259\n00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720\nHow

that's the worst case because\n\n271\n00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192\nIn which case you can\n\n272\n00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240\nGo to the end\n\n273\n00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824\nSet alarm in\n\n274\n00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,856\nSo let's think about BST okay so we will compare PST with linked list\n\n275\n00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160\nTime to fine\n\n276\n00:22:52,928 -->

00:24:50,176\nOkay\n\n298\n00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560\nOkay so I didn't specify whether the best the balanced binary search tree or not\n\n299\n00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,144\nSo if I didn't specify\n\n300\n00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936\nAddressing the whiskey\n\n301\n00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128\nSuper didn't specify a place in the worse case or worst case a PST can be like this\n\n302\n00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,712\nSaudis in Turkey wear\n\n303\n00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:28,064\nThe worst case scenario it actually say\n\n304\n00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,184\nWe respect to the big all they had the same\n\n305\n00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976\nWorst-case running time\n\n306\n00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840\nBut if it's best if the Beast is balanced\n\n307\n00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656\nThen which is better\n\n308\n00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984\nVsts better\n\n309\n00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592\nHow better I go today\n\n310\n00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896\nLogin\n\n311\n00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064\nSo what would average get so let's think about the link list\n\n312\n00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088\nOkay\n\n313\n00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648\nWedding you are the linked list\n\n314\n00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256\nAnd I am\n\n315\n00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,888\nWe're trying to compute average case analysis\n\n316\n00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,776\nFor the link list so how long does it take to find an element in average\n\n317\n00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:27,456\nSo I would like you to write down in your pen and paper\n\n318\n00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112\nAnd I think I will just go down the tutors we go down and it's our discussion is open\n\n319\n00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672\nAnd then and will work okay\n\n320\n00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072\nThought star Computing start computing\n\n321\n00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,632\nCan-Am\n\n322\n00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288\nWe'll see how you guys do okay the uterus go down and then we'll see what people are doing it right\n\n323\n00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088\nSo did you compute\n\n324\n00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488\nWhy am I\n\n325\n00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888\n3821 LK\n\n326\n00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288\nYou're okay\n\n327\n00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688\nDo you compute\n\n328\n00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088\nJonathan average\n\n329\n00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488\nCan an average be divided by 10\n\n330\n00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288\nCan you do a vine-dresser channel English\n\n331\n00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688\nCan you go buy me something in English\n\n332\n00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088\nSnap it sequential I sent you\n\n333\n00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488\nWhat kind of random acts as if you could just like an array you could do a binary search\n\n334\n00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888\nThe concept of linked list is like you\n\n335\n00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:28,288\nYou have been accessed from one to other so the underlying implementation we don't really know sometimes\n\n336\n00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688\nLyrics by using a razor not right what is the length\n\n337\n00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088\nConcert 112 that's okay\n\n338\n00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,184\nLet's see what you guys find out\n\n339\n00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840\nOkay start boarding in five second of stop one\n\n340\n00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,984\n345 stop\n\n341\n00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616\nFN gun\n\n342\n00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432\nWhy is the door open\n\n343\n00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,552\nSet up a research one we got one right\n\n344\n00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,648\nHe got the second one how many operation to\n\n345\n00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696\nCapital One\n\n346\n00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,792\n3 if you get the end on average\n\n347\n00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,936\nMean why are we assuming that it\n\n348\n00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,520\nWhich Keys would be equally likely\n\n349\n00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,648\nOkay so why do you think the average gas oven\n\n350\n00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864\nAverage of 10 over 2\n\n351\n00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,656\nWhy is it in Novato\n\n352\n00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288\nOkay\n\n353\n00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,688\nOkay is you mean so you're assuming that if he is equally likely\n\n354\n00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272\nSo if we didn't specify anything\n\n355\n00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344\nWe're going to assume that they are all equally like it\n\n356\n00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904\nVelocify specify\n\n357\n00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,536\nThe frequency of each key and I will say it one is hundred percent\n\n358\n00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,400\nOkay that's that's my distribution\n\n359\n00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704\nThen it's different\n\n360\n00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008\nQuestion\n\n361\n00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,640\nIf wanted hundred percent what's the average game\n\n362\n00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,904\nNo you could you could search 1000 times\n\n363\n00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352\nFind how long on an average\n\n364\n00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,424\nSearch 1000 times\n\n365\n00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216\nOn average\n\n366\n00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776\nHow how long do you get\n\n367\n00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,360\nBecause I said 100%\n\n368\n00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152\nYou always 21\n\n369\n00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:19,808\nEquity all all of the keys and if I didn't specify they're all equally likely so they have\n\n370\n00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,392\nOne by and chance right so you multiply with this\n\n371\n00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,232\nAnd you got the orphan\n\n372\n00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304\nConnecticut\n\n373\n00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352\nOkay let's move on\n\n374\n00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656\nUnless you have any doubts\n\n375\n00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,176\nOkay so the average gases can be tricky\n\n376\n00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576\nIf you have done the reading for the best average gas analysis it's really too\n\n377\n00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512\nSo I read at home how it's done when will touch up on the house\n\n378\n00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,864\nYou can do it like that in in very simple steps\n\n379\n00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,704\nNot going to the details the details are in the book\n\n380\n00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,776\nAnd I have to read the book\n\n381\n00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,640\nThrowing up to think about run time on average case\n\n382\n00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,248\nSo let's think about this specific BST\n\n383\n00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,624\nSo this for a specific BST and 1 BST here\n\n384\n00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280\nIs in there looking for one of the element in the BST what is the average number of comparison you need to\n\n385\n00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,096\nMake to find an element\n\n386\n00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,728\n446 Pacific BST\n\n387\n00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504\nSend this case the runtime is pencil equivalent to number of comparison remake\n\n388\n00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,856\nOkay 10 seconds\n\n389\n00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464\nThe one\n\n390\n00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488\nTwo\n\n391\n00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,560\n345\n\n392\n00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328\nStop\n\n393\n00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776\nOkay\n\n394\n00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544\nWhy\n\n395\n00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,664\nSexy assume that each key is equally likely\n\n396\n00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016\nSo you have\n\n397\n00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,112\nOne here and then two and then three\n\n398\n00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,720\nThe 1 plus 2 plus 3 divided by 3 is equal to 2\n\n399\n00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096\nTonight's party specific BST\n\n400\n00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,960\nThe assumption here is that each key is equally likely\n\n401\n00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:55,456\nSo that the two minutes options are we make when we tried to do this analysis\n\n402\n00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,088\nFor the average gas the first one is at all keys are equally likely to be searched for\n\n403\n00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000\nBut that's all you have all of these different kinds of BST with three now\n\n404\n00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120\nSo you could\n\n405\n00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912\nHave\n\n406\n00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,752\nAll of these cases can deeply like Lincoln\n\n407\n00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800\nAfter that second assumption\n\n408\n00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,616\nSecond assumption is that\n\n409\n00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,760\nThese BST are created using a particular interest and Order\n\n410\n00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576\nA particular in certain order\n\n411\n00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232\nSo the next exemption would be all in certain orders are equally likely\n\n412\n00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:47,168\nIf you insert the keys in a particular order you have a PST particular bsd111\n\n413\n00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704\nTrinidad BSD\n\n414\n00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360\nI was young that all keys are equally likely so that the\n\n415\n00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:01,248\nNN compute average and casing that specific tonight\n\n416\n00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904\nLet's work out this specific case here so for the cases where is equal to 3\n\n417\n00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584\nSt Nicola tree what's the average number of comparison we need to\n\n418\n00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120\nDefine an element\n\n419\n00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,680\nIn any BST with peanuts\n\n420\n00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:27,360\nSo take a pen and paper and start Computing this and\n\n421\n00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176\nWe'll see how you guys do\n\n422\n00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760\nRehabs in ok\n\n423\n00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392\nStar Computing and start voting in the mail\n\n424\n00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696\nSimultaneously if you want\n\n425\n00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,664\nNobody has any clue\n\n426\n00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,296\nHow to start how do we start\n\n427\n00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,696\nSafari Street figure out the number of average number of comparison\n\n428\n00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816\nAnd then later on we can put the total average\n\n429\n00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888\nOkay\n\n430\n00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752\nSony computer the first one in last Light now\n\n431\n00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056\nDo it for the second one third one\n\n432\n00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080\nPortland\n\n433\n00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,408\nAnd then let's do an average of the whole thing\n\n434\n00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736\nOkay\n\n435\n00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488\nRu computing\n\n436\n00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048\nAre you confused\n\n437\n00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,632\nHot\n\n438\n00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,472\nOkay let's start Computing today\n\n439\n00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:05,408\nAll right before we start Computing let let me see what you guys did for 10 seconds for this\n\n440\n00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:11,808\nOne two three four five\n\n441\n00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856\n7\n\n442\n00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648\n889\n\n443\n00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,768\n$0.10\n\n444\n00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096\nWow so you have a distribution\n\n445\n00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,168\nAs many people said\n\n446\n00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,568\nValletta let's try to compute so we'll do it again okay we'll do it again\n\n447\n00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848\nSo\n\n448\n00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,248\nTake your pen and paper and start Computing what's the number for the first one\n\n449\n00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512\nFor the second one\n\n450\n00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312\nOkay the rest you do it yourself\n\n451\n00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,992\nDo it yourself and then we'll go out again\n\n452\n00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184\nOkay so let's see 10 seconds\n\n453\n00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464\n10 seconds\n\n454\n00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,656\nCr123\n\n455\n00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680\n4\n\n456\n00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728\n5 top\n\n457\n00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104\nOkay\n\n458\n00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640\nGood\n\n459\n00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200\nSo let's do it\n\n460\n00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760\n5 by 3\n\n461\n00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576\nWhat's going on\n\n462\n00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768\nMy thing is not working\n\n463\n00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792\nHenry\n\n464\n00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584\nFactory Shoe\n\n465\n00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680\nOkay good\n\n466\n00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,520\nSo five by three for this\n\n467\n00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080\nAnd this one is\n\n468\n00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,944\nI would say I like 16533\n\n469\n00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992\nSet alarm 6 by 3\n\n470\n00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088\nAnd then so eat\n\n471\n00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,976\nEach of these are equally likely and that the second and has a mission\n\n472\n00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,144\n3 / how many are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 1 by 6\n\n473\n00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424\nX\n\n474\n00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216\nAddison\n\n475\n00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824\nWhich is equal to\n\n476\n00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:55,296\n36 - 2/3 into 16 - 34 by 18\n\n477\n00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856\nOkay\n\n478\n00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440\nGood\n\n479\n00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,840\nAlright so let's say\n\n480\n00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128\nSo if you see the book\n\n481\n00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,784\nIt's pretty a detail how you can do it for a general BST\n\n482\n00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720\nAnd it's actually or login in average\n\n483\n00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,536\nYou're not assuming that they are balanced\n\n484\n00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120\nBernard assuming that GST has to be balanced\n\n485\n00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936\nSo far all possible scenario\n\n486\n00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240\nIf you think about\n\n487\n00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568\nAny insertion order\n\n488\n00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735\nSo in general if you do operations on a BST or regular beer\n\n489\n00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039\nOn average gas\n\n490\n00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319\nIt's really good\n\n491\n00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855\nIt's all login\n\n492\n00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,183\nBut it was gas is baclofen\n\n493\n00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,583\nWhat gate is open but there's a big difference between love and in love login\n\n494\n00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,167\nWhen I have it it's it's really good\n\n495\n00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959\nVST delay plugin\n\n496\n00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:23,871\nSo go through the day analysis and the book and\n\n497\n00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175\nYou can see whites of login\n\n498\n00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,295\nOkay so for your programming assignment\n\n499\n00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855\nWill compute the run time\n\n500\n00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207\nAnd we won't compute by doing this kind of math\n\n501\n00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607\nAnswering compute by reading actual analysis L&M\n\n502\n00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887\nEmpirical analysis\n\n503\n00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983\nNumerical analysis is basic level\n\n504\n00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519\nHave a timer\n\n505\n00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,847\nWhen will actually have a clock\n\n506\n00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,175\nWhy do Accord is running\n\n507\n00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711\nWe'll have a timer\n\n508\n00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,503\nAnd start the timer\n\n509\n00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,807\nAnd the end will stop the timer\n\n510\n00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391\nAnd we'll figure out how long\n\n511\n00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183\nThe core will run\n\n512\n00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,327\nThe first will enslave the data structure we don't want then it's late edition part\n\n513\n00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495\nI want to see the runtime of a particular algorithm so before we start the garden\n\n514\n00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031\nWe\n\n515\n00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823\nStart a timer\n\n516\n00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871\nOkay\n\n517\n00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,759\nThen let the algorithm finish on a problem of size n\n\n518\n00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575\nThe end we can vary\n\n519\n00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,879\nThe winning when we very end\n\n520\n00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671\nThere on time will change\n\n521\n00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951\nMac Daddy\n\n522\n00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511\nTell us how\n\n523\n00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,119\nThe Bell Garden is performing on bigrentz\n\n524\n00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:55,007\nAt the end of the garden will start the timer and then we compute the time\n\n525\n00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,407\nOkay so you'll be asked to measure your algorithm\n\n526\n00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967\nUsing this timer\n\n527\n00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271\nOn on your programming assignment\n\n528\n00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295\nOkay\n\n529\n00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,695\nAnd you might have to turn in a report with some graph of this number\n\n530\n00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999\nIf you very end\n\n531\n00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:22,399\nHow the rent IMAX weekend and you might have to come in till 9:40 o'clock case\n\n532\n00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679\nIn that situation\n\n533\n00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991\nYeah this is a demo and so I didn't and prepare the demo on the thing you can do\n\n534\n00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:41,087\nDo it yourself right so if you could do it on any piece of court\n\n535\n00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743\nIf you start looking at the programming assignment you wouldn't have even know how to start it\n\n536\n00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:52,607\nTimer how to stop a timer and have the computer run time\n\n537\n00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887\nOkay\n\n538\n00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031\nAlright\n\n539\n00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639\nSo for the PS2\n\n540\n00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,015\nYou will Implement a dictionaries and an autocomplete\n\n541\n00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207\nToday the checkpoint in for the checkpoint you need to implement insert and fine in it\n\n542\n00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,999\nTo be really fast\n\n543\n00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:27,167\nThe final commission is autocomplete and benchmarking service\n\n544\n00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,007\nThis is where you start and stop your timer and figured out there on time\n\n545\n00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,383\nSo you know what autocomplete is\n\n546\n00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807\nEverybody knows where. Oh, so you going to implement an autocomplete function\n\n547\n00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:49,951\nEver given a big dictionary so there will be a lot of words in the dictionary\n\n548\n00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:56,095\nSo you can afford to look at all the words and suggest the autocomplete\n\n549\n00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655\nYou have to think of all the data structure\n\n550\n00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:03,519\nHow to capture this and how to efficiently compute\n\n551\n00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,615\nFirst few frequently occurring words\n\n552\n00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919\nQuickly\n\n553\n00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,527\nAnd then Benchmark Review times\n\n554\n00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087\nSo that two different data structures\n\n555\n00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,647\nBST\n\n556\n00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207\nA hashmap and a try\n\n557\n00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999\nTo know about BST\n\n558\n00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,351\nAnd this week will go to the tie and the half man\n\n559\n00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143\nOkay\n\n560\n00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,543\nAnd we compare the run times for all of the free dictionary\n\n561\n00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,711\nAnd we'll try to comment on how they perform engine\n\n562\n00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735\nOkay\n\n563\n00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,879\nDavits gave the best skaters in the worst-case so that's up here too\n\n564\n00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,023\nAnd it's really challenging and all of these two different data structure\n\n565\n00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071\nThe start early\n\n566\n00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,775\nSo let's think about tries so what is a try\n\n567\n00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431\nTry is also a data center that is represented as\n\n568\n00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831\nJust like BS test3\n\n569\n00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111\nDifferent kind of tree\n\n570\n00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:28,511\nIn it sometime it's called prefix trees or and Expressway\n\n571\n00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:34,911\nSo eat snow inside this try doesn't contain the word\n\n572\n00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,495\nSearching for the whole word\n\n573\n00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287\nIt's more content\n\n574\n00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335\nA part of the word\n\n575\n00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,223\nAnswer for example if you have a binary try so this could be a word\n\n576\n00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015\nIn every note\n\n577\n00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063\nStores Only\n\n578\n00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:57,695\nOne visit right 101 baked in this case\n\n579\n00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,303\nOkay so if you want to create the binary try for this\n\n580\n00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607\nWe have\n\n581\n00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,447\nBest friend so we start with\n\n582\n00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727\nThe root note\n\n583\n00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:15,359\nAnd we have a ward call 0 0 0 0 13420\n\n584\n00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895\nChildren\n\n585\n00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431\nCreate another note\n\n586\n00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479\nKoala zero and Eleanor\n\n587\n00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,783\nZero another note\n\n588\n00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,111\nHow many zeros or Zeroes\n\n589\n00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:31,999\n4071 and then we create a note and remarked that note\n\n590\n00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,351\nMiso and I will Mark the North and it's\n\n591\n00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,751\nBasically a bit of lag on the note saying that it's a word that\n\n592\n00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,031\nLet me in\n\n593\n00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,431\nIt's a word that is inserted in this latest update\n\n594\n00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367\nSo when we travel this when we find a note with this flag the blue color\n\n595\n00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:03,487\nWell I know that that would actually present in the Trap\n\n596\n00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191\nSo let's see if you can answer this we have couple of minutes so far this tribe does the\n\n597\n00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,335\nStructure of the tri depend on the order in which the keys are inserted\n\n598\n00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:24,991\nIt's apt to try like this does the try the structure of the time depend on the Earth\n\n599\n00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,599\nOf insurgent\n\n600\n00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,999\nKP auto AC create different order does it\n\n601\n00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815\nHow come up with a different way\n\n602\n00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:46,495\nOkay few more seconds and 5 Seconds more one\n\n603\n00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,359\n2345 stop\n\n604\n00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,039\nOkay you could split so will discuss this next time\n",
