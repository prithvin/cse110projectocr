1
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Okay

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Hey good afternoon everyone good

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
So a couple of announcement to Pier 1 final submission again

4
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
Wednesday I'm sure you must have some

5
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,840
Metro checkpoint for pa1 right now

6
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Double dare review quiz review quiz today

7
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
Good morning I hope everyone remember that

8
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
And they go to reading exercise night so I'm getting some emails

9
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
Can you might have forgotten about the reading exercise to make sure that you do your reading exercise before

10
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
For you come to class and that's the way you get the Disco

11
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,424
Lines from the reading and exercise

12
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:17,312
Ep2 will release on Thursday

13
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
Okay so the weather confusion on pa-18 Raider Plaza

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
I think last time when I discussed I told her I told you that

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
Left so if I tease is a type of authority that you did Aphrodite

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,912
You got a BS Dino

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:48,800
But that's not true so that's not correct so

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
What happens if I throw works on a container class right so we would like to think of

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
BST as a container of data some kind of data so when you dear friends

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,976
A Knight Rider on a container class it should return a data data type

21
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
Okay so when you if you have an iPhone BSD

22
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
No vsti territory when you need a friend said it should

23
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
What should return

24
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,664
What's your name

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
Yeah that data

26
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Should I turn the data

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
So if you have operations standard output

28
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
The data has to overload the operator

29
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Okay so before we begin any other questions

30
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
Next

31
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,296
Yeah because integer is holiday automatic writing

32
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
You can overload only for an object ID cannot Overlook native Native

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
Skylake Boolean or integer

34
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Double

35
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
Any other question

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
The next programming assignment is significantly hard

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,504
So you should start right away

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
I want this significantly higher it's it's many steps okay if it

39
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Simple if you think about it if you had if you know the concept that many

40
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Stepside on Adelaide

41
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Erica

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Togo's 4227 time in Dallas

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
And mighty with Christ which is really important for. I hope you have some time from Alcatraz

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
We can get some and I think that reading exercise for multimeter

45
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
I guess I'm assuming that you have read

46
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
About motivator

47
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Let me go through them

48
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,615
Okay so last time we were going through this big ol

49
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:38,015
Runtime analysis so we have big oversized big Peter versus big Omega

50
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,575
I am so we have all

51
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
Beta and Omega

52
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
So we had this piece of corn

53
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,863
So we wanted to find out what the Big O

54
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Hard disk

55
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
What's the run time in Tampa Bay go to how do how do you work this

56
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:10,527
To try to compute the number of steps that they sell Garden computer

57
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
How to how do you find the number of steps we have to lose out on love goes through

58
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
How many times

59
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
End times

60
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
N

61
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
10 - 110

62
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
End times

63
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,823
0 - 2 + -1

64
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,559
Search a 10-1 times they open

65
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,983
In management and an X I'm kind of confused

66
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Okay starts with theaters and times

67
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,271
Is it in - 1 + 10 - 1

68
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
Yeah I'm right okay I was kind of confused so

69
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
4 + -1 things okay

70
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
So the first time

71
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,679
What's the number of steps for this inner loop

72
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,591
For the first time when are you going to zero

73
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
When are you going to zero

74
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
This goes from

75
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
One

76
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
N - 1

77
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Thanks a lot

78
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
N - 1

79
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
That's what the first one

80
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
What's the second one

81
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
10 - 2

82
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,287
10-2 so tell me again

83
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
One red

84
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
Okay

85
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
So that is equal to

86
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
And into n minus 1 by 2

87
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
The what the Big O for this

88
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,511
That's the number of steps

89
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Is equal to

90
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
N Square

91
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,031
Okay is it all off in

92
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
Can it be off into the profile

93
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Elga

94
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
So let's think about Omega-3

95
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
And square

96
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
Kennedy in

97
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Yes

98
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Yes

99
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,239
Kennedy into the profile now

100
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
What are Tita

101
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
In square

102
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Peter of M

103
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
No

104
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Peter

105
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Anthony Barr 5

106
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
No

107
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Okay

108
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:36,351
So I think as big as the bomb

109
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
Omega is the lower bound Peter is the tightest boundary

110
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
That is both from upper side and Lower Side

111
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
If you have

112
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
11 squared and Omega Red Square then it must be mm square

113
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
Okay so this is

114
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
Not to confuse with

115
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:10,399
Different kinds of analysis letter if I want to ask for tequila questions

116
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
Four baskets in Alice

117
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:19,103
Are worth getting a little you think of this as worst-case situation

118
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
What average gas mileage

119
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
Each of this one time can be bounded by big ol big day today,

120
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Celexa

121
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
Do this exercise

122
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
So this is big or challenge what's the tightest

123
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,855
Okay so we want the tightest big around for the core

124
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
How about

125
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Okay 10 more seconds

126
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
One

127
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
Five six

128
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,855
7 8 9 10 stop

129
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Wow that's a nice girl there

130
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,447
So many people said or off in

131
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,335
Similarly One login

132
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,455
Login to you have all kinds of answers

133
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:09,183
Okay let's do a group of thinking just talk for a while

134
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
And then we can do this again so mean why you can ask your English teacher if you have any

135
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,983
Confusions RTA

136
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Why did you guys think

137
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,983
And Logan and Logan

138
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
Down right down with a piece of paper and see and computer

139
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,783
Yeah just do it do it

140
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:13,183
What's the first step Quest Loop

141
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:19,583
Give me later that are related to news but the first time it does the inner loop

142
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
How many Star between run do it and headed up to

143
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
Oh yeah I would encourage you to start actually

144
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
Using a pen and paper then only got it right if you just

145
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
Think aloud you might be wrong okay let's do it let's do another word

146
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,983
Now and see where you are

147
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,383
15 seconds to do it quickly

148
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
910 1 2 3 4

149
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,135
Five stamp

150
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,535
Alright so busy

151
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,119
Be as it is now but they never answer app

152
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Nugget

153
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
So let's do it

154
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
So we have to lose

155
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
Okay

156
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:38,175
Tune-ups so let's think about how many times the inner loop runs for the first time

157
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Second time

158
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,207
2N is equal to in by 2

159
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
The second time how many times does Louisville run

160
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
How many times

161
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
Invite to

162
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,799
Satin by two

163
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Current time

164
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
And by 4

165
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Uptown yoga

166
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
You got one right

167
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
So if you add this thing

168
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
What happened

169
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
This is actually less than 2 in

170
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Okay

171
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,391
How is it to end

172
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487
If you might have some series you're right one by two

173
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:59,327
So it's basically an

174
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
-1 divided by

175
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,287
What's a 1-1 by to find something like that

176
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:15,455
Figured out at home how you can finish that this is actually

177
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
2N

178
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
Alright let's do it again so let's say we have is here so if we have to time

179
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
We have two and less and less invite to class after 2

180
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
I know that there was a practice to as mine SF us

181
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Now this whole thing

182
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
Will go away right in two

183
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,407
Now we have 2 N -1

184
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Thank

185
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Okay

186
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Search

187
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
What is this the tightest Big O for this

188
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
The tightest Big O

189
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
If it's not the tightest it's is this okay

190
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055
So that's okay that's not the tightest question

191
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,479
Isn't this an infinite Loop

192
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Why there's no infinite Loop

193
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
When you start dividing by 2 and N is an integer

194
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:35,071
If you started it by tomorrow at some point of time and will be equal to

195
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
Zero

196
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Nbc.com

197
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,031
When anyone won back to exactly zero

198
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Okay

199
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:54,783
Mulan how long till this is a tricky question okay I'm playing tricks

200
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:01,183
How long does it take to find whether or not an element is

201
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
Sorted linked list

202
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Okay

203
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,583
Remember tricky question

204
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
How long does it take

205
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
NS sorted linked list

206
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
Okay 5 more seconds

207
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,535
One two three

208
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
45 stop

209
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Okay

210
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:57,247
That's some people who study

211
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,879
So I want to hear why people said who said he okay

212
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
For some it's old one

213
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
Saw the way you access this link this is from this point the right you cannot directly on them

214
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
Excessive

215
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,999
But you are right so for some it's worth one for which one is 12 one

216
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
For a constant number of a letter we have in the first few

217
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,519
If the numbers are the first relocation is 2 of 1

218
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,127
So far if you're searching one it's all of One

219
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,855
If you're starting to you can also think of that old one because not depending on the end it's too

220
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Okay

221
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
It is

222
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:15,327
So here actually I didn't specify

223
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,239
I didn't specify whether you're looking for the worst case

224
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Are the best gas

225
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Are the average case

226
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
So there is not enough information

227
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
So I mean this is not to be confused with so we have

228
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,767
What's the worst-case right

229
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
Our best case

230
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
Are average gay

231
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
But this has nothing to do with

232
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
How

233
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,871
Recalculate

234
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,991
Ornate Omega or Tita

235
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,087
So for each one of them I can have it analysis done

236
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,415
Second Step what were the worst Kidz Bop

237
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,255
So you can have them what's the best case that you can have

238
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
Papa bondye Bon Appetit Owen

239
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655
What's the average game you can have all of this analysis

240
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,543
So this is just something to think about right when you

241
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615
Do analysis runtime analysis

242
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
So if I say what's the worst case

243
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Runtime

244
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,159
For the tightest upper bound

245
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
Then how would you answer it

246
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:55,167
Open that's a worst-case Applebaum

247
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,567
At Westgate Bingo okay

248
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
Okay

249
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,783
Zenefits well let's see

250
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
So you already answered this

251
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,512
How long does it take to find whether or not an element in the sorted linked list in the bay

252
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,864
Okay so we're looking at the best case

253
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,192
And I will thinking about

254
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
The tightest upper bound here

255
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,848
So what's the best case

256
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,432
12 1

257
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
Okay so what happened in the worst case

258
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,904
CertiFit store dent

259
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
How long does it take to find

260
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
In the

261
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
Ruscus

262
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
For the tightest Applebaum

263
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Okay

264
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Select Staff

265
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
15 seconds.

266
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,808
2345

267
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Stop

268
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Okay

269
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
So I am

270
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,656
Okay that's the worst case because

271
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
In which case you can

272
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
Go to the end

273
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
Set alarm in

274
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,856
So let's think about BST okay so we will compare PST with linked list

275
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,160
Time to fine

276
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,720
Is open in Westgate

277
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
In a linked list

278
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,840
Is the time to find better

279
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Worse

280
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:06,496
Are the same in the worst-case 4bst within elements

281
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,312
Today's the PST and it's in English

282
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
So what do you think

283
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,864
Okay 5 more seconds one

284
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Two

285
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
Three four

286
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
5

287
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
Stop

288
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:49,504
Arch I want to see

289
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,856
I want to hear why people and Cersei

290
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,144
Okay

291
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,544
Worst case if it's the same

292
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,128
Okay

293
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,944
Any other question and answer

294
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
So did you

295
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,272
Radiohead

296
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,976
So it okay let's let's hear something from the first yest would be better

297
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Okay

298
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:06,560
Okay so I didn't specify whether the best the balanced binary search tree or not

299
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,144
So if I didn't specify

300
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Addressing the whiskey

301
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
Super didn't specify a place in the worse case or worst case a PST can be like this

302
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,712
Saudis in Turkey wear

303
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:28,064
The worst case scenario it actually say

304
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,184
We respect to the big all they had the same

305
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
Worst-case running time

306
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
But if it's best if the Beast is balanced

307
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
Then which is better

308
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Vsts better

309
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,592
How better I go today

310
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Login

311
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:00,064
So what would average get so let's think about the link list

312
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
Okay

313
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,648
Wedding you are the linked list

314
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,256
And I am

315
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,888
We're trying to compute average case analysis

316
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:19,776
For the link list so how long does it take to find an element in average

317
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:27,456
So I would like you to write down in your pen and paper

318
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
And I think I will just go down the tutors we go down and it's our discussion is open

319
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
And then and will work okay

320
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:43,072
Thought star Computing start computing

321
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,632
Can-Am

322
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
We'll see how you guys do okay the uterus go down and then we'll see what people are doing it right

323
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:05,088
So did you compute

324
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
Why am I

325
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
3821 LK

326
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
You're okay

327
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Do you compute

328
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Jonathan average

329
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
Can an average be divided by 10

330
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
Can you do a vine-dresser channel English

331
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
Can you go buy me something in English

332
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088
Snap it sequential I sent you

333
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
What kind of random acts as if you could just like an array you could do a binary search

334
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:21,888
The concept of linked list is like you

335
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:28,288
You have been accessed from one to other so the underlying implementation we don't really know sometimes

336
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:34,688
Lyrics by using a razor not right what is the length

337
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
Concert 112 that's okay

338
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,184
Let's see what you guys find out

339
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,840
Okay start boarding in five second of stop one

340
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,984
345 stop

341
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
FN gun

342
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
Why is the door open

343
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,552
Set up a research one we got one right

344
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:15,648
He got the second one how many operation to

345
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Capital One

346
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,792
3 if you get the end on average

347
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,936
Mean why are we assuming that it

348
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,520
Which Keys would be equally likely

349
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,648
Okay so why do you think the average gas oven

350
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,864
Average of 10 over 2

351
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,656
Why is it in Novato

352
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,288
Okay

353
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:10,688
Okay is you mean so you're assuming that if he is equally likely

354
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
So if we didn't specify anything

355
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
We're going to assume that they are all equally like it

356
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Velocify specify

357
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,536
The frequency of each key and I will say it one is hundred percent

358
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,400
Okay that's that's my distribution

359
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
Then it's different

360
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
Question

361
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,640
If wanted hundred percent what's the average game

362
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,904
No you could you could search 1000 times

363
00:30:54,208 --> 00:31:00,352
Find how long on an average

364
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,424
Search 1000 times

365
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
On average

366
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,776
How how long do you get

367
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,360
Because I said 100%

368
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,152
You always 21

369
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:19,808
Equity all all of the keys and if I didn't specify they're all equally likely so they have

370
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,392
One by and chance right so you multiply with this

371
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,232
And you got the orphan

372
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Connecticut

373
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
Okay let's move on

374
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,656
Unless you have any doubts

375
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,176
Okay so the average gases can be tricky

376
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576
If you have done the reading for the best average gas analysis it's really too

377
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
So I read at home how it's done when will touch up on the house

378
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,864
You can do it like that in in very simple steps

379
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,704
Not going to the details the details are in the book

380
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,776
And I have to read the book

381
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,640
Throwing up to think about run time on average case

382
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,248
So let's think about this specific BST

383
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,624
So this for a specific BST and 1 BST here

384
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:33,280
Is in there looking for one of the element in the BST what is the average number of comparison you need to

385
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,096
Make to find an element

386
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:41,728
446 Pacific BST

387
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
Send this case the runtime is pencil equivalent to number of comparison remake

388
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,856
Okay 10 seconds

389
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
The one

390
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,488
Two

391
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,560
345

392
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Stop

393
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
Okay

394
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
Why

395
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,664
Sexy assume that each key is equally likely

396
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,016
So you have

397
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:30,112
One here and then two and then three

398
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,720
The 1 plus 2 plus 3 divided by 3 is equal to 2

399
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,096
Tonight's party specific BST

400
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,960
The assumption here is that each key is equally likely

401
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:55,456
So that the two minutes options are we make when we tried to do this analysis

402
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,088
For the average gas the first one is at all keys are equally likely to be searched for

403
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
But that's all you have all of these different kinds of BST with three now

404
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,120
So you could

405
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Have

406
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,752
All of these cases can deeply like Lincoln

407
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
After that second assumption

408
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,616
Second assumption is that

409
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,760
These BST are created using a particular interest and Order

410
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
A particular in certain order

411
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
So the next exemption would be all in certain orders are equally likely

412
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:47,168
If you insert the keys in a particular order you have a PST particular bsd111

413
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,704
Trinidad BSD

414
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:55,360
I was young that all keys are equally likely so that the

415
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:01,248
NN compute average and casing that specific tonight

416
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904
Let's work out this specific case here so for the cases where is equal to 3

417
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
St Nicola tree what's the average number of comparison we need to

418
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,120
Define an element

419
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,680
In any BST with peanuts

420
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:27,360
So take a pen and paper and start Computing this and

421
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176
We'll see how you guys do

422
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
Rehabs in ok

423
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
Star Computing and start voting in the mail

424
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
Simultaneously if you want

425
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,664
Nobody has any clue

426
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,296
How to start how do we start

427
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:13,696
Safari Street figure out the number of average number of comparison

428
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,816
And then later on we can put the total average

429
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Okay

430
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:26,752
Sony computer the first one in last Light now

431
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
Do it for the second one third one

432
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Portland

433
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,408
And then let's do an average of the whole thing

434
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Okay

435
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,488
Ru computing

436
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Are you confused

437
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,632
Hot

438
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,472
Okay let's start Computing today

439
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:05,408
All right before we start Computing let let me see what you guys did for 10 seconds for this

440
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:11,808
One two three four five

441
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
7

442
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,648
889

443
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:20,768
$0.10

444
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,096
Wow so you have a distribution

445
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:27,168
As many people said

446
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,568
Valletta let's try to compute so we'll do it again okay we'll do it again

447
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
So

448
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:41,248
Take your pen and paper and start Computing what's the number for the first one

449
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
For the second one

450
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
Okay the rest you do it yourself

451
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,992
Do it yourself and then we'll go out again

452
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
Okay so let's see 10 seconds

453
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,464
10 seconds

454
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,656
Cr123

455
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
4

456
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,728
5 top

457
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,104
Okay

458
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Good

459
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
So let's do it

460
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
5 by 3

461
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,576
What's going on

462
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:28,768
My thing is not working

463
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,792
Henry

464
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
Factory Shoe

465
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,680
Okay good

466
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,520
So five by three for this

467
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,080
And this one is

468
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:18,944
I would say I like 16533

469
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,992
Set alarm 6 by 3

470
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
And then so eat

471
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,976
Each of these are equally likely and that the second and has a mission

472
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:38,144
3 / how many are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 1 by 6

473
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
X

474
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,216
Addison

475
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
Which is equal to

476
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:55,296
36 - 2/3 into 16 - 34 by 18

477
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:57,856
Okay

478
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
Good

479
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,840
Alright so let's say

480
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
So if you see the book

481
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,784
It's pretty a detail how you can do it for a general BST

482
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:34,720
And it's actually or login in average

483
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,536
You're not assuming that they are balanced

484
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,120
Bernard assuming that GST has to be balanced

485
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,936
So far all possible scenario

486
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
If you think about

487
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
Any insertion order

488
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:56,735
So in general if you do operations on a BST or regular beer

489
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
On average gas

490
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
It's really good

491
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
It's all login

492
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:05,183
But it was gas is baclofen

493
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,583
What gate is open but there's a big difference between love and in love login

494
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,167
When I have it it's it's really good

495
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,959
VST delay plugin

496
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:23,871
So go through the day analysis and the book and

497
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
You can see whites of login

498
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,295
Okay so for your programming assignment

499
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,855
Will compute the run time

500
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
And we won't compute by doing this kind of math

501
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:44,607
Answering compute by reading actual analysis L&M

502
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
Empirical analysis

503
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
Numerical analysis is basic level

504
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,519
Have a timer

505
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,847
When will actually have a clock

506
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,175
Why do Accord is running

507
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
We'll have a timer

508
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,503
And start the timer

509
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,807
And the end will stop the timer

510
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,391
And we'll figure out how long

511
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
The core will run

512
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,327
The first will enslave the data structure we don't want then it's late edition part

513
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:22,495
I want to see the runtime of a particular algorithm so before we start the garden

514
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
We

515
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Start a timer

516
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
Okay

517
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,759
Then let the algorithm finish on a problem of size n

518
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
The end we can vary

519
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,879
The winning when we very end

520
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,671
There on time will change

521
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Mac Daddy

522
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,511
Tell us how

523
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,119
The Bell Garden is performing on bigrentz

524
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:55,007
At the end of the garden will start the timer and then we compute the time

525
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,407
Okay so you'll be asked to measure your algorithm

526
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
Using this timer

527
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:06,271
On on your programming assignment

528
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,295
Okay

529
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:13,695
And you might have to turn in a report with some graph of this number

530
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,999
If you very end

531
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:22,399
How the rent IMAX weekend and you might have to come in till 9:40 o'clock case

532
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,679
In that situation

533
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:36,991
Yeah this is a demo and so I didn't and prepare the demo on the thing you can do

534
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:41,087
Do it yourself right so if you could do it on any piece of court

535
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
If you start looking at the programming assignment you wouldn't have even know how to start it

536
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:52,607
Timer how to stop a timer and have the computer run time

537
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Okay

538
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Alright

539
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
So for the PS2

540
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:10,015
You will Implement a dictionaries and an autocomplete

541
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
Today the checkpoint in for the checkpoint you need to implement insert and fine in it

542
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,999
To be really fast

543
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:27,167
The final commission is autocomplete and benchmarking service

544
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,007
This is where you start and stop your timer and figured out there on time

545
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,383
So you know what autocomplete is

546
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
Everybody knows where. Oh, so you going to implement an autocomplete function

547
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:49,951
Ever given a big dictionary so there will be a lot of words in the dictionary

548
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:56,095
So you can afford to look at all the words and suggest the autocomplete

549
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,655
You have to think of all the data structure

550
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:03,519
How to capture this and how to efficiently compute

551
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,615
First few frequently occurring words

552
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Quickly

553
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,527
And then Benchmark Review times

554
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
So that two different data structures

555
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,647
BST

556
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
A hashmap and a try

557
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
To know about BST

558
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:28,351
And this week will go to the tie and the half man

559
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
Okay

560
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:36,543
And we compare the run times for all of the free dictionary

561
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,711
And we'll try to comment on how they perform engine

562
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,735
Okay

563
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:50,879
Davits gave the best skaters in the worst-case so that's up here too

564
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,023
And it's really challenging and all of these two different data structure

565
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071
The start early

566
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,775
So let's think about tries so what is a try

567
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
Try is also a data center that is represented as

568
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,831
Just like BS test3

569
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
Different kind of tree

570
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:28,511
In it sometime it's called prefix trees or and Expressway

571
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:34,911
So eat snow inside this try doesn't contain the word

572
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:38,495
Searching for the whole word

573
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
It's more content

574
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
A part of the word

575
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:48,223
Answer for example if you have a binary try so this could be a word

576
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,015
In every note

577
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,063
Stores Only

578
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:57,695
One visit right 101 baked in this case

579
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,303
Okay so if you want to create the binary try for this

580
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,607
We have

581
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,447
Best friend so we start with

582
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
The root note

583
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:15,359
And we have a ward call 0 0 0 0 13420

584
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,895
Children

585
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
Create another note

586
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479
Koala zero and Eleanor

587
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:22,783
Zero another note

588
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,111
How many zeros or Zeroes

589
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:31,999
4071 and then we create a note and remarked that note

590
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,351
Miso and I will Mark the North and it's

591
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:42,751
Basically a bit of lag on the note saying that it's a word that

592
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,031
Let me in

593
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:50,431
It's a word that is inserted in this latest update

594
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:58,367
So when we travel this when we find a note with this flag the blue color

595
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:03,487
Well I know that that would actually present in the Trap

596
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:12,191
So let's see if you can answer this we have couple of minutes so far this tribe does the

597
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:18,335
Structure of the tri depend on the order in which the keys are inserted

598
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:24,991
It's apt to try like this does the try the structure of the time depend on the Earth

599
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,599
Of insurgent

600
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,999
KP auto AC create different order does it

601
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,815
How come up with a different way

602
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:46,495
Okay few more seconds and 5 Seconds more one

603
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,359
2345 stop

604
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,039
Okay you could split so will discuss this next time
