DOES IT WORK?

 

procedure explore(G = (V,E), v)
visited(v)=true

 

 

 

If it doesn’t work then there is a for each edge (m);
vertex u that is reachable from v if not visited(u), then
but does not become true. explore(G,u)
ywrir'“’/‘W‘“‘“" ﬁ’l/t
V % W

let w be the first reachable vertex
that is not true and so 2 is the last
reachable vertex that is true.
