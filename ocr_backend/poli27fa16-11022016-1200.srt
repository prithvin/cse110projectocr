1
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,744
On Monday we watch the film cities on speed.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
The transformation Bogut I just want to point a couple things out in there

3
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,936
So that is when Marcus did the

4
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
Determining dentist the disarmament programme was social and was volunteering

5
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Social

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
It wasn't a lot

7
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
There was no law requiring people to turn in their guns

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
And then for hit For You Second Amendment fans

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344
And then II

10
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
A second opinion oh so you know they have Columbia unfortunately has a

11
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
Okay guys can't you stop talking please

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Thank you

13
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
Columbia houses

14
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
Unfortunate

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:26,272
Proviso that mirrors only hold office for two years soap in USA

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,088
I was really hurry to get that

17
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,136
Infrastructure revision

18
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
Gonna need to do

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,536
Non consultative and non-participatory way what you know

20
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,888
Aroused public anger so 18% support

21
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
Imagine there was

22
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
Also

23
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,152
Very ambitious infrastructure

24
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,968
Redesigned but it was carried out over

25
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,064
Many years and with more consultation more participation

26
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
So

27
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,208
What were as selfish as we discussed today I caught the sign and justice

28
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
First as law alone created

29
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,376
Justice now requires

30
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Also

31
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,520
Social norms in support of legal obedience

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,848
Really cat the war of all against all and urban Columbia

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
The two weeks ago we read

34
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
A paper about

35
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
It in the poor neighborhoods of many managing where it was like Hobbes war of all against all

36
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
We would pass through

37
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
677 day and the murder rate was the highest

38
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
In the world and maybe in in modern history

39
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm going to look at the construction of Justice in Bogota meta-gene which was

40
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
Had to do a three making the culture and remaking the built-in Farm

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
Emory going to examine evidence social psychological evidence and then

42
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,528
Performance evidence intention

43
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Sporty's Hills

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
So first we have to consider

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
Alone

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,072
How's the fishing for Change and no it's not illegal centralism

47
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
The doctrine of legal centralism

48
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
Is the idea

49
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
The most places most people obey most laws

50
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,616
And that's true in some places like Sweden of us

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,968
But as soon as you know that's not true all over the world

52
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Laughter

53
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,672
Pencil is always the best way to bring about social change and to remedy

54
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Social hard harm so

55
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,792
What is there harmful social norms

56
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:51,936
You know a lot of people practice maybe the arm for the directly

57
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
I cannot just be simply outlawed

58
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,384
Well this is something I've worked on in theory and practice and

59
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,040
Ice cream criminalisation is often proposed as a remedy against harmful

60
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,856
Social norms like female genital cutting

61
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,952
Early female marriage caste discrimination

62
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
I'll give you so I'll give you an example

63
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,447
So early female marriages been illegal in India since 1929

64
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,335
And 50% of the population of girls are married under age 18

65
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Because people

66
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
Are bad or anything or reasons for

67
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
Nearly marriage and have to address the reasons

68
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,183
Rose and threatening to I said you throw grandma and jail right

69
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,535
Any law that requires you to throw grandma and Jo is not is not going to work

70
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
4

71
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,399
I work with UNICEF UNICEF is so

72
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,775
There's a lot of things in one of its program system is to

73
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,311
Work with

74
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
Developing countries to

75
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,039
Establish legal ban on corporal punishment of children in school so I was in the USA

76
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,135
Event with a is a 60 from all over the world

77
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Niacin

78
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
Anybody from a country where corporal punishment has been legally banned where it actually no longer

79
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
Takes place in the school's raise your hand

80
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Hand

81
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,751
Everyone left and no one raised their hands because the

82
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Because

83
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
The donor countries in United Nations

84
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:42,527
Pressure people pressure countries to pass the band they have other things to worry about

85
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,087
You're not giving an alternative way

86
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:51,231
Alternative methods alternate training to maintain discipline in school you're not giving out here there's just this Authority is this

87
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
You can no longer do that or will put you in jail

88
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:59,679
The song you know for changing is harmful practices but effective way so

89
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,543
The standard story on why people obey the law

90
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,383
What time is so long because there was

91
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,735
The law was not obeyed in Bogota and make energy

92
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Engine

93
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
It wasn't

94
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,391
An important consideration in people's decisions

95
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
I saw the standard story

96
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
About why people obey the law because

97
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,839
One is more of a believe the authority is legitimate

98
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
The other reason is that they fear legal punishment

99
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,495
But seldom mention is whether or not

100
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
There's the social Norm of legal and social norms you know is informal is social is social approval

101
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Social disapproval

102
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
So

103
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,319
Being motivated by social and legal businesses

104
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
You know if

105
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
You and your family would be

106
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
Horrified by the opinion of your friends and family should you be arrested and go to court for some

107
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
Criminal offense

108
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,823
You're eating here and concern to avoid that kind of Shame

109
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
NSN effect

110
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
And US criminology this is a summary of the

111
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
Multiple studies and there's nothing

112
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Nothing

113
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Later

114
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
This is the general View

115
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Why do people obey the law

116
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
I believe that illicit conduct is wrong

117
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
That's Amore

118
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,191
And the fear of peer disapproval embarrassment or social stigma

119
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
Courage offending behaviour so

120
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Is people standard story is

121
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
People bit

122
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,663
People by the law because they fear punishment

123
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
Empirically it turns out that

124
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:55,391
Extra legal sanctions of the moral reasons for compliance the social reasons for client

125
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Compliance

126
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,511
Are much stronger than the term effect of the legal sanctions

127
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
The pedialyte with legal sanctions

128
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
Applies to a small portion of the population

129
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
Let's say that is prone to

130
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
To break the law

131
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
And the moral and social

132
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Motivation

133
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Arkham

134
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Compel remainder the pop

135
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,087
African convinced the remainder of the population to

136
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,463
Halo soy

137
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,023
What If You observe failure to pay

138
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
Esenboga Tron the early 1990s

139
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,935
Why well there's no social normally would be

140
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Andaz Napa

141
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
In some pockets of the city

142
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,871
There is a social number legal Defiance you were a cool dude outlaw

143
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,735
You know if you if you spit on the on the lawn on the place

144
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Another reason is Sofia

145
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
New legal Norms too far from the current social Norm

146
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Or both

147
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Back

148
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
So

149
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
When there's no when there's no social normally go obedience illegal command to obey the law has no effect

150
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,263
So which of these is a no shooting sign that has the statutory

151
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
Fitness picture of excited

152
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Hand

153
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,455
In the right-hand case federal law doesn't hurt anybody

154
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,159
You know when the new legal Norm is too far from the current social Norm

155
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Best wind

156
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
So free sample

157
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
Wyndham

158
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
It in

159
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
Is San Diego a country I know

160
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:51,103
Many people practice polygamy both

161
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:57,247
Both because they were Muslims and part before they were Muslims

162
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Several of the ethnic groups practice polygamy

163
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,135
Practice polygamy so when they became independent

164
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,535
And Senegal Dakar was the capital of French West Africa Senegal sophisticated number ways

165
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
Sonic on Independence in 1963

166
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Abolished

167
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,519
Polygamy even though maybe 70% of populations doing it

168
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:25,663
So the laws never you know if it's ridiculous to enforce the law that somebody people Define

169
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
And

170
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
So the new legal Norm was too far from the currents

171
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Social and what they did

172
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
When they passed a law to say

173
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,487
You could opt into monogamy or polygamy in the

174
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
Original marriage contract

175
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
So maybe you don't like putting me but you leave it up to free choice

176
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
You know it's a half-measure

177
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Eruption of free choice

178
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Hemet alts

179
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,919
That's a presentation I just gave your presentation I frequently

180
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,271
Take 2 hours to make that's a little thin but you get the idea of a social Norm

181
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Probably going to be insane here we are

182
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
Here are some data

183
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:12,255
Homicides per hundred thousand in the three largest cities in Colombia

184
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
The blue is Mary Jane

185
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Highest

186
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Highest in a limit

187
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,983
Purple is the world average

188
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
I said

189
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Turn on 2000

190
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Who is Mary Jane in 9294

191
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,503
This is when they said they were making progress but people said well not much

192
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
And this is today and it's actually gone down

193
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
More

194
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
And this is simple guitar

195
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
Gone down a lot

196
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
And then this is Kali

197
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Circus, until recently didn't have these transformative initiatives and

198
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
City

199
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,263
In part because in college

200
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
Inoculating the traditionally fused

201
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
And that blocked

202
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
I reported that blocked it kind of fun

203
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Reformist

204
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
So I'm taking a slide

205
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
With permission from Xavier.

206
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Who is part of this

207
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
And

208
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,911
So is his Doctrine was that for

209
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
For the reform you needed to

210
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,591
Recognizes three different systems of norms that can regulate

211
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
Citizens behaviorist legal Norms witches

212
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
Legitimacy the positive and negative reasons for complying is legitimacy of authority respect for

213
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
For the law

214
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
Or fear the authorities penalties

215
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Moral Norms to you know

216
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,839
Prompted by good conscience or to avoid bad conscience

217
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,727
And social norms with your motive compliance is motivated by approval of others

218
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
That you care about

219
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
Or disapprove of others that you care about

220
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
And so what he did when he took office he said

221
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
People in court Bogota don't follow the law so we can't change the laws we have to change the social

222
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
Norm's first

223
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,047
Frozen pizza change was worse than focus on changing laws he focus on changing social

224
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
The nurse in the city

225
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
Think I'll call this the harmonization of norms

226
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,495
Cuz he said there shouldn't be any there should be legal Norms that

227
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
REM moral

228
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,407
You know that that require you to do something it's against morality so legal Norms should be

229
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Harmonize

230
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,039
With moral Norms at the same time the social norms that we have

231
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
Should be should Support Compliance

232
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:51,487
With moral rules and legal rules in other words to everyone

233
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
Should be disposed

234
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,375
Approve socially approved or socially disapproved

235
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
Socially proof of compliance with more illegals

236
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
And if this is a

237
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
But you just can't

238
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,103
Cast laws and threaten to shoot people and get these

239
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
Get this to happen especially in the in this

240
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
Environment of great disorder

241
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
So here's just some examples

242
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Hello

243
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Law morality and

244
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,327
Culture are so this is social can be divorced C is culture social

245
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
So

246
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
You know it's kind of

247
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Venn diagram

248
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Illegally

249
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:40,639
Legally permitted in the Squarespace in the cultural and social Community ran the Morley permitted is here

250
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
So

251
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,271
He wanted invasive flirting is

252
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,647
Socially permitted and legally permitted but not morally permitted in Bogota

253
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
A very Catholic Latin American Woman

254
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,143
Living in a very Catholic environment goes to Miami to abort with that's legally permitted but socially

255
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
Frowned upon and morally

256
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
I found upon

257
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
I helping sight-impaired person cross the street that's legal aid Morro Bay

258
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Socially permitted

259
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Over paying taxes

260
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
In Bogota

261
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
That is morally and legally permitted but socially is considered so stupid and can

262
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Contemptible how could any sane person pay more

263
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Leo

264
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,839
Rape is not legally socially

265
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Morally permitted

266
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Escape the Room

267
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
You know the house like a

268
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
About tax or sales tax and

269
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,295
When you buy something from the store or street vendor

270
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
If they're keeping records that when they give you a store receipt and that's how the tax authorities keep track of things that

271
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
And that the practice was look

272
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,399
Hi charge you less and you don't ask me for a receipt that was so

273
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,751
Morally and socially permitted even though not legally permitted

274
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,127
Illegally selling goods and public spaces it was a huge problem

275
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,759
Informal construction of neighborhood had seen expropriating land setting up

276
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
Building permits

277
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Whirling socially permitted not legally

278
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,231
And I'm driving a police officer

279
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,119
Morally and socially permitted even though

280
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,703
An amazing day so she encouraged

281
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Alright so big

282
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
People

283
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,295
We're living in a desperate situation and they wanted way out in this is on the phone this weird guy I got elected

284
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
The song

285
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
So

286
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
Condensation or suicide are nice and moral social and legal

287
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:08,607
So he found a value that could be accepted in a

288
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Secular

289
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:17,055
Realistic Society of life is sacred so in the movie you saw them marching in the black T-shirt La Veta Sagrada

290
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Life is sacred and that was also

291
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,991
I'm a number to talk about symbolic violence this huge March

292
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
I know half a million people

293
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Happens when

294
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,743
Gorillas were killing people in the city

295
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,095
And people were riled up and they wanted revenge and so

296
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,679
Who created this March so that people could

297
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,751
Symbolically respond to the violence

298
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
And

299
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
And I

300
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
Browns and actually responding to the violence that's driving a spiral of violence

301
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:02,879
And then the other four more motivation that he promoted Woodstock not finalized

302
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
And so this is it

303
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Pictures of

304
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,815
Brian example of cultural politics in that picture he's wearing

305
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,191
A bulletproof vest so that's because the first four left-wing Narco gorillas

306
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Things were going so well in Bogota that they were jealous and they wanted to discredit it so they

307
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,967
Intelligence found out that they were planning to assassinate Marcos

308
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,623
So I had to wear a bulletproof vest usually wear them here close to not let you know to keep it a secret

309
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,719
So he wore it over his clothes and he cut a hole over his heart

310
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,303
And then he had a press conference and they said

311
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Why are you doing

312
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,471
I said well I have to wear this bulletproof s cuz the park is threatening to kill me

313
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
But I cut a hole in an over the heart to let them know

314
00:18:54,591 --> 00:19:00,735
But I'm still willing to communicate with him and there is they're going to communicate peace will renounce file

315
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
And we can get along

316
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
And that

317
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,719
So embarrassed the fact that you know they were

318
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
Seriously discredited by

319
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Hispaniola

320
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,679
So you say so

321
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
Try they did this sub

322
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,591
They use social epidemiology you know that's very strict measurement of

323
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
Morbidity and mortality

324
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,295
Across the territory in which causes are and they found the traffic

325
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
Traffic mortality and morbidity

326
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
Besides the criminal political violence was the greatest doing the greatest damage to people so they wanted to increase

327
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Defiance with traffic laws

328
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,679
How many complied with the traffic was just

329
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,471
What they were born into

330
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
So how to harmonize

331
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,847
The campaign moral social legal so moral

332
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
If they painted the black stars wherever somebody been killed so when you come up to a busy intersection

333
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Is a pedestrian

334
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
Can you attend UC 9 black stars

335
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
You're going to sink

336
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
Think twice

337
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
If your driver and you're rushing through

338
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
It's a reminder

339
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
And that was the

340
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,983
Again with Securus because the local

341
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,847
A local practice was putting up crosses where people were killed

342
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,943
Assist and officials in His official it can be really just so that

343
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
The black store

344
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
And then

345
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,623
They decided that one problem with traffic

346
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
With traffic is that

347
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,791
In traffic people are like inside these

348
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,607
Bigtincan sensor the normal

349
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Social

350
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,471
Give me take-out face-to-face interaction is absent so

351
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
If somebody when you're walking and somebody absolutely or accident I cut you off you had to say what

352
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
Happened I say sorry sorry

353
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:12,063
Traffic when somebody cuts you off you never know where they have an excuse

354
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Purchase location and I get extremely angry

355
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:18,208
And that's why I don't carry a gun in my car

356
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,048
Because I can so angry I want to kill somebody right

357
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,608
Immense

358
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:30,496
I'm I'm glad they're broadening the Genesee

359
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Interchange freeway

360
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:40,480
So I mean you're still here waiting in line for like 5 minutes and some guy comes up yet

361
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,928
So it's a soccer and football Country Soccer countries have these red cards and white people could use in traffic

362
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,232
Can people use them and actually

363
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,072
Became part of Bogota culture and people would whip them out at parties

364
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
And they thought

365
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,168
And then they found that the red card

366
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,776
I didn't work because it was kind of fun

367
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
Led to disagreement so they created this

368
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Another one

369
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
Hits

370
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,808
It's meant to be a combination of

371
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
I think I

372
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,512
A person lying dead on the sidewalk and a? But it's so you whip out

373
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,400
If somebody cuts you off or somebody does something wrong in traffic instead of the red car

374
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
Frank are you put the?

375
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
Que pasa what's going on man

376
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,312
Did you mean to do that what you doing social life

377
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
If somebody

378
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
If you're at a party and somebody

379
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,296
Play Cut and I took your plate or something you wouldn't say Hey you say

380
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,368
Hey you say hey you bastard give me that

381
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
Hackensack

382
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
What's going on how are you

383
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Did you know that

384
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
And they

385
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:09,568
They fired the corrupt traffic please and as his father replace them with

386
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,408
Mine's initially 40 and then 400

387
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
So in a country where

388
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
So proud of dog

389
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:26,720
Would not be bothered by the police giving the traffic ticket which I would just rip up and throw on the ground

390
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,584
The prospect of being really killed by a clown on the street

391
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
It's just

392
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:40,032
It's something that you want to avoid if you've ever had a mine imitate you

393
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
It's the worst thing in the world

394
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,664
Because he

395
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,272
You know we're all kind of shy about who we are and all your chips and stuff paid

396
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
It's unbearable

397
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
And also

398
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,656
The Spanish treasury was the direct in the end Rec

399
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:13,568
So this was done downtown where everybody goes and then it's on the TV and radio and news

400
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,592
The whole city

401
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
But you seem what Marcus wants this for people that talk about it he and his like the public arena in and son

402
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:26,112
Every family he does something crazy so every household

403
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,416
In Bogota is talking about it

404
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
And the kids at dinner are saying

405
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,584
Mom and dad why did the crazy man put the clowns

406
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
If the

407
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
In the street

408
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
And I say well then there's like people talking about he thinks that people should have a the traffic was more and then more people

409
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Movie alive

410
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:51,968
Getting people discuss the reasons we passed a lot so clean to build the traffic

411
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
Annalisa nothing would have happened

412
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,856
And I need to change some of the laws that was very

413
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:02,208
Free controversial to close down the bars at 1 a.m.

414
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
The current law

415
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
But also

416
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
I can at least

417
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,424
Bacon 1st 1 a.m. and then

418
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,496
When they got results they stand for 3 a.m.

419
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:20,896
Indirect result was tab everybody fighting about this in public like and then

420
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
Marcus and being able to say well there's all these people who died in

421
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,344
Gunfights and drunk driving accidents what are we going to do about it

422
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
Changing the social

423
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,952
So you know drunk driving used to be

424
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,768
Socially and legally acceptable in the Ice Age

425
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,376
Have you can legally unacceptable and still was somewhat socially on it

426
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Socially acceptable

427
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
And then overtime

428
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
You know your peers would say no you can't do that

429
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
And

430
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,104
Look theater

431
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,040
Here is where so red is positive black is Colombia

432
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,624
Midas Bogota and so here's for those

433
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,464
Finishes when you're taken and here's the results

434
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Now I'm just switch the minion

435
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
Fettuccine

436
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:25,408
And I'm sure there's lots of five minute YouTube so I'm managing I chose this one

437
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,248
Does the video quality is really good and also

438
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
It shows

439
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
Are the two leaders of this is not that the leaders did everything but I just want to show you that it was the result

440
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,048
Public public policy decisions

441
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:49,632
Physically I'm so fancy

442
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
You know that our past has a lot of things related to buy

443
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
It was written all over because of the

444
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
The answer

445
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
Silent world

446
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,832
Wide or solo

447
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Narrow road or

448
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
Directions

449
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
So we decided to

450
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:04,032
What's the weather all these parties

451
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:10,432
What transformed the city of San Jose

452
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,832
Feeling believed in what we were doing because

453
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:23,232
Information

454
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
Comfort we have to communicate

455
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,432
3 days definition

456
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
We need some things about the places in the neighborhood

457
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,432
Usually they will say whatever you need

458
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:20,832
I'm in the theater now

459
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:27,232
The most beautiful thing you have to be

460
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:40,032
Sign

461
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:18,432
Indigo

462
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:37,632
Directions

463
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:44,032
Selena

464
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:03,232
Columbia

465
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Okay so

466
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,800
The thing with the cable cars was that the poor squatted communities were at the top of the hill and it would

467
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Would take them

468
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,384
They were socially culturally

469
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,712
Isolated the police weren't there

470
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,528
And building the Metro cables connected

471
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
Does a

472
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,368
Poor communities to the center

473
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,720
It was symbolic and practical inclusion

474
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:38,048
Along with the building of the spectacular

475
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,656
The spectacular architecture to give

476
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,008
To give people aspirations and hope about the

477
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
Future remedies for that

478
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Getting started and now they can try for more

479
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
What are they doing

480
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,016
In Baton and Mary Jane Mary Jane

481
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
There's a monster

482
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
Restoring moral order and I'm going to

483
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
Explain that a little more in a second

484
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,048
Where's the Revival and creation of public spaces

485
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
They had them

486
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,448
Design rules now so we had to sign rules that were promoted

487
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,032
Consistency across the city but also allowing for

488
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,104
Local Variations by than just monotony

489
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Faith

490
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:31,040
In each City they built Transportation Systems efficient transportation systems

491
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,160
That you made life more efficient in the 1800

492
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,816
Easier like in the economic sense of things being cheaper and easier but also in the symbolic sense uniting

493
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
In the margins with the center

494
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,240
Say Julian in Bogota they deliver it

495
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,872
Energy Water Sanitation transport and education to every

496
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,456
Last house sold before that transmission

497
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,760
How many households without the services

498
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,624
They built the Magnificent invoices a magnet schools

499
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,000
And then they have this combination thing with is called the library Park it's a park

500
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,352
Library in a crash that is a babysitting facilities

501
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:21,984
At the center or are you know what the center of the Earth

502
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Select neighborhood

503
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,872
And they also transform social

504
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,760
One problem is when you get a certain level of violence becomes naturalized

505
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,600
And people don't notice it and they think it's just the way things are

506
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,392
Social indifference

507
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
Comes about

508
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,464
Empire Rap by

509
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,512
Why all this publicity

510
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,656
Name a visible traffic me and political violence criminal violence

511
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
And ways out of it

512
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,288
So some of the

513
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,592
10 comments with questions before I go on

514
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,832
In the Bogota

515
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Case

516
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
A bunch of people and pay their taxes

517
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,328
So that end before 1991

518
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,888
Mirrors were appointed by

519
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
The federal government

520
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Samir's for chest

521
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,752
Wheeler Dealers

522
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:33,152
So after this reform where the mirrors are directly elected the first one reform that the Bogota tax code

523
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
And then

524
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Marcus

525
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
Undertook

526
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:42,880
Your harmonization of norms measures to increase tax compliance and tax compliance

527
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Like doubled

528
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,000
And then

529
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,560
KUSI weather

530
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:56,960
Check the crowd and they privatize the public utility and they got a hole

531
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,800
Buttload of cash and he did that for the purpose of

532
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,104
Doing the physical transformation

533
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,664
And then if he saw the movie

534
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,968
Fitness secreta confidence

535
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:12,064
Of this city has been a mess of confidence International investors

536
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
Mercer drawing foreign investment

537
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,000
In the case of amazing same thing but a slower process

538
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:25,888
Building up ever greater credibility making the city more attractive to

539
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,216
To afford investment part of that was like

540
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,776
But you don't see there is like

541
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,664
Latin or Spanish moss education more education

542
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,944
So like

543
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Everybody goes to school

544
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,296
Poor people get off

545
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:51,232
Free entry to tertiary school why are they doing this not just to be nice

546
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,304
But they have a tracking Workforce is that

547
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
Answer

548
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,240
The whole thing has to be coordinated you need money to write

549
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:08,896
Petco Park getting money to spell incredible is pretty stout we're no longer having 400 homicide

550
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,712
400010

551
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:19,904
So they're giving a short version of some very interesting experimental literature

552
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,000
We know that too

553
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
If your environment where you see social norms being violated you're more likely to violate the social norms yourself

554
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,520
This is a nice controlled experiment everything is controlled same

555
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,128
Same day of the week same time same weather

556
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
So in one case

557
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
There's a sign this is

558
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,720
This Thread Circle means no so there's no graffiti don't write graffiti on the wall

559
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:59,072
And then you see a bunch of bicycles there and the experimenters

560
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,728
Put an annoying circular on the tricycle with rubber band have you ever found one circular and your body

561
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,568
And then

562
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,152
The other condition was there's no graffiti sign

563
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
And there's lots of graffiti on the wall

564
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
So

565
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:23,648
Then they measured what what happens in the first condition where there is evidence of social

566
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,440
Non-compliance no graffiti

567
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
People would come

568
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
Texas circular

569
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,400
Fold up and put in her pocket and the second condition many more people took the circular

570
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,680
I threw it on the ground

571
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,752
Trying that there can be

572
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,800
Spillover

573
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:45,920
Define evidence of defiance of one social Norm can spill over and cause defiance

574
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
Have another social Norm

575
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,320
There were about four

576
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,416
Similar experiments in this line providing convergent results

577
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
Later the same team 2

578
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
The opposite thing the opposite

579
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,448
Weather evidence of norm compliance

580
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,496
Would spill over

581
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:15,616
Weather evidence of compliance with one arm would spill over

582
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
To cause compliance with a separate on

583
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:22,272
And again they have like about four different

584
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
Setup San

585
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Hi this is

586
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,416
They're all interesting but in this one

587
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,560
In the back in the very back you see somebody sweeping

588
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
So that's the treatment

589
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:43,520
A condition so in one condition somebody is doing a Public Act they're sweeping the

590
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,312
Sidewalk in front of their house

591
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
India and the other condition

592
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,432
There's nobody sleeping so

593
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:58,112
So somebody's coming down the walk and there's that the person on the left there has a bag of gross

594
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
Stamina

595
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,464
Person Windows subject gets near

596
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,024
The Confederates bills her grocery bag

597
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,352
And then so with a major is where the Third

598
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
Bystander the subject

599
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,216
Helps pick up the groceries

600
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
If she walked by

601
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
Somebody sweeping the street

602
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,128
She was much more likely to help

603
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,272
The Confederate who expelled her groceries so the idea

604
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
So this

605
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,344
So the idea that

606
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,440
You know what would happen over time and May

607
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,280
Meaning of showing a high level of social norm compliance

608
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
Maybe the Broken Window Theory

609
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,424
Please sing which doesn't have any

610
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Which doesn't

611
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:51,360
Which is hard to measure when it's affecting the city's cuz he don't have any control

612
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,455
Whose experiments indicate

613
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,015
These mechanisms serve foot so

614
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:05,183
I study and then she go and in Senegal that this actually

615
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
Does Sam

616
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,815
Human rights education among other things and people say

617
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,679
You know the most important we have the best thing in that whole program is when we

618
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:18,239
Organize to clean the streets

619
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
You know

620
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,871
50 words that have to do if you can write and Sonny says what is traffic fines have to do with human rights

621
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:29,503
Was cleaning the streets first they learn Collective action with one another you know

622
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,087
And that spills over to being able to Collective action with another thing

623
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,695
Grocery stores moral order in the village they have a nice place in

624
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:42,559
I'm a pleasant place to live in visitors coming to see this is such a nice place

625
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,631
And I say yeah yeah we're building for a great future

626
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
So

627
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,823
The other remarkable things that they learned in that program this was the

628
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,663
The most memorable one the one that people talked about the most

629
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
Panda

630
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Are you going to show up

631
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
Why because

632
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,903
In the old days you know

633
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
The stuff that people had was

634
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:16,095
Organic stuff that would rot so people would just step aside

635
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,399
And then you get plastic bags

636
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Hair

637
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:25,055
All the modern detritus so in the village that doesn't Regina quick clean itself

638
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
There's just

639
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:31,199
1000 plastic bags blown everywhere and cans and

640
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,623
People have to adopt the new Norm of cleaning when these new products or I mean the same

641
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,695
So you can see

642
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
How

643
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
This is a

644
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
Is Bogota where are

645
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
Where

646
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,215
Where they are manifesting

647
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
You know

648
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,591
Social norm compliance

649
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
Kimora Lee ordered Society

650
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:07,551
That they hope it's going to spill over and the evidence says that it does and then here

651
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
And

652
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
Machine

653
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
UC

654
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
At the lower left to see the main Metro which is one of the first two actions

655
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,679
One of the first things that was done in this Rehabilitation

656
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,471
Transformation program

657
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:30,079
And then on the right you see the Metro cable cars

658
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
Which are not just for show and

659
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,247
Where to connect the marginal neighborhoods to the city

660
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,111
And then upper right you see one of the library Parks that's in

661
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,439
What are one of the worst most violent

662
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,743
Neighborhoods and left UC

663
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
Covered escalators again

664
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
So that the people at the margins

665
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,959
Which happened to be at the top of the ball could get down to the center transforming your life

666
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,239
And actually

667
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,615
Horns s initiate the most violent city in the world is now like a tourist destination

668
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
So

669
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,295
Hipster tourist like to go there and write the cable cars and they're even like

670
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,623
There's like two guys that were the toughest

671
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
There still problems believe me okay

672
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:23,583
Like one reason finances gone down is organized crime is reached a pact that they're not going to

673
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,143
You can keep the number of public murders down

674
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
Freeway

675
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,007
If your uterus like me you can go to community

676
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,567
Take the cable car Laguna 13

677
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,687
And I'll be the gang members in the rappers to show you around and you pay them

678
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,039
I don't think I'll do that I don't like to

679
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,343
Electronic harassment

680
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
So

681
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
So

682
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
I know that

683
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,631
Sorry you are Engineers I'm not trying to patronize you but

684
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
Hearsay evidence that

685
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,775
Neighborhood physical infrastructure can reduce mileage

686
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
So that's something

687
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,479
Best kind of consideration is something to think of InDesign so

688
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,831
I provided shoes

689
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:22,975
This paper it's a natural experiment they were able to match treatment neighborhoods to comfortable control neighborhoods

690
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:28,863
So the treatment was the Met installation of the Metro Cable in the spectacular infrastructure

691
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,191
Versus match neighborhood switch did not have that

692
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
Hand sewing

693
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,287
Number of violence with

694
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Decreasing all over managing

695
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,711
At the same time so you need to isolate a treatment effect

696
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,271
That's why we have this comparison in Decline

697
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
Send the treatment areas

698
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,183
66% greater decline in the official homicide rate

699
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:56,255
A 75% greater decline of resident

700
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,351
Reports of homicide you know not all reported to the place

701
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,959
Desperate and also

702
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,031
You can take that as an indicator

703
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,871
He is a good indicator of

704
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
Associated provement smite

705
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,759
Proxy for Associated improvements and then also

706
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,599
Another study showed that

707
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:27,999
Access to employment opportunities Doublemint metrocable users I guess that's not surprising but

708
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
It's nice

709
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,583
It's always nice to find in a controlled

710
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,399
But I'm just saying

711
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
It was okay

712
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
And then

713
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,031
In both Bogota and Medellin

714
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,847
A systematic research

715
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
Good research design data collection guide the formation and evaluation of program

716
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:56,927
Amazing solidaria that's a city Department

717
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,303
Does capabilities measures of property I'm going to explain the capabilities approach

718
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,351
I think next week

719
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
What's the wave

720
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:08,447
It's a different way it's more objective way

721
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,983
Measuring

722
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,847
Changes in people's well-being

723
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,663
Rather than just their subjective happiness

724
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:19,967
Hands

725
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:25,599
They measured progress and Manga Global development indicators and

726
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,647
Which shows that there is

727
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
You know

728
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,327
Slow progress in some areas and then complete lack of progress in other areas switching forms there

729
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
Oceanside

730
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
