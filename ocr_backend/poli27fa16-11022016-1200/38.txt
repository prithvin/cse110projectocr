Social Ethics of the Built Environment
in Bogota and Medellin

Demonstratively restoring moral order
Revival and creation of public spaces
— Design rules promoting consistency with local variation

Transportation systems that unite the margins with the
center

— Practical and symbolic

Energy, water, sanitation, transport, education to every
household

Magnificent schools, libraries, parks, creches built in
poorest areas

Transforming social indifference to traffic mayhem, political
violence, criminal violence
