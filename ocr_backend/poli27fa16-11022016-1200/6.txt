Evidence on Legal Obedience

US Criminology: Influence of Extralegal Sanctions

- Nagin and Pogarsky (2001, 869)

— "A belief that illicit conduct is wrong [moral],
and the fear of peer disapproval,

embarrassment, or social stigma [social]
discourage offending behavior.”

— Further, several studies investigating the
relative strength of both sanction forms find

~ the "conforming influence of extra/ego] sanctions
to be far greater than that from legal sanctions.”
