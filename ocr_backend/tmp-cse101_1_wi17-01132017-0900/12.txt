CONNECTED UNDIRECTED GRAPHS

 

Definition: An undirected graph G is connected if for every pair of
vertices v,u in G, there exists a path from v to u.

exglore only reaches one connected component of the graph,
namely the set of vertices reachable from v.

To examine the rest of the graph, we need to restart explore on a
vertex that has not been visited.
