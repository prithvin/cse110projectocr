visited(v)=false if not visited(u), then
for each yertex yz' prev(u)=v
If not VISIted(v), then cc++: explore(G,v) explore(G , u)

 

 

DFS is a procedure that calls explore on G until all vertices have
been reached

cc stands for connected component and by the end of DFS, cc will
be set to the number of connected components.
