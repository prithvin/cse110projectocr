DOES IT WORK?

 

 

 

 

procedure explore(G = (V,E), v)
visited(v)=true
At some point, 2 was set to true for each edge (m):
and then you loop through all ifnotvisited(u), then
vertices including w. explore(G,u)
we “r' “’/“‘*\6‘ “‘ "' ﬁ’l/t
v % W

w has not been set to true so
explore(G,w) and set w to true.
