 

HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

 

Worst case scenario, you pass
through all vertices and set them to
true which takes O(|V|) then after
you set it to true you look at each
edge incident with it which will take
O(deg(v)) for each vertex v.

What is

 

 

procedure explore(G = (V,E), v)
visited(v)=true
for each edge (v.u):
if not visited(u), then
explore(G,u)
