HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

 

 

procedure explore(G = (V,E), v)
visited(v)=true
for each edge (v,u):
if not visited(u), then
explore(G,u)

So the procedure assigns true to |V|
vertices and checks 2|E| edges when
it has visited all vertices.

 

 

 

This algorithm has a runtime of
0(lV|+|E|)-

For graph algorithms, this is called
linear time, since the runtime grows
proportional to the number of
vertices and edges.
