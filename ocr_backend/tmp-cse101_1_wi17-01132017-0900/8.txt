 

KEEPING TRACK OF PATHS

 

At the end of the procedure, the
algorithm will have assigned true to
each vertex that can be reached by
v. What if we want to know what
those paths are?

C;

 

 

procedure explore(G = (V,E), v)
visited(v)=true
for each edge (v,u):
if not visited(u), then
prev(u)=v
explore(G,u)
